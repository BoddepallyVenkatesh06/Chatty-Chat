    <h1><a name="top">Standalone Version</a></h1>
    <p>The only difference between the regular JAR version and the Standalone
        lies in how it is started. The Standalone contains the <code>Chatty.exe</code>
        which executes the <code>Chatty.jar</code> in the <code>app</code>
        directory using the bundled JRE in the <code>runtime</code> directory,
        which removes the need for Java to be installed and ensures that Chatty
        is started with the same Java version it was compiled and tested with.</p>
    
    <h2>Chatty.cfg</h2>
    <p>The <code>Chatty.cfg</code> is located in the <code>app</code> subdirectory
        (where also the <code>Chatty.jar</code> and other Chatty related files
        are).</p>
    
    <h3><a name="cfg-launch">Launch Options</a></h3>
    <p>You can add <a href="help.html#launch">launch options</a> to the <code>Chatty.cfg</code> under the
        <code>[ArgOptions]</code> section. These are given to Chatty when it is
        started. What you would normally separate by
        space goes on it's own line. For example:</p>
    
    <pre>
[ArgOptions]
-channel
joshimuz
-d
H:\\Chatty\\settings1</pre>
    
    <p>The format has changed in newer Standalone versions, which requires a
        prefix on each line:</p>
    
    <pre>
[ArgOptions]
arguments=-channel
arguments=joshimuz</pre>
    
    <p>Note that for this file, backslashes need to be escaped. For this option
        you can alternatively also use forward slashes, which Java should
        understand.</p>
    
    <p>When you specify any launch options on the commandline/in the shortcut,
        then the launch options in the <code>Chatty.cfg</code> are ignored.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="cfg-jvm">JVM/Java Options</a></h3>
    <p>The <code>[JVMOptions]</code> section contains parameters that are given
        to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) when Chatty is started. There should
        already be a few options there by default, for example:</p>
    
    <pre>
[JVMOptions]
-Xmx400M
-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false</pre>
    
    <p>These restrict the maximum heap (memory usage) to 400MB and disable
        Hardware Acceleration to reduce GUI issues.</p>
    
    <p>In newer Standalone versions this needs to be under the <code>[JavaOptions]</code>
        section and also requires a prefix on each line:</p>
    
    <pre>
[JavaOptions]
java-options=-Xmx400M
java-options=-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false</pre>
