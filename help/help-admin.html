    <h1><a name="top">Admin Dialog</a></h1>
    <p>
        <a href="#access">Access</a> | 
        <a href="#status">Change stream title/game/tags</a> | 
        <a href="#commercials">Run commercials</a>
    </p>

    <p><em>Open the Admin Dialog via <code>View - Channel Admin</code> or by
            right-clicking on the channel to open the context menu and choose
            <code>Channel Admin</code>.</em></p>
    
    <p>The Admin Dialog is always opened for the currently active channel,
    unless there is no channel open (which is the case just after you started Chatty),
    in which case it will open for your own channel (you login with). The
    channel is automatically changed to the currently active channel unless the
    "Channel - Fixed" option is enabled in the Admin Dialog context menu
    (right-click on an empty space in the Admin Dialog).</p>
    
    <h2><a name="access">Access</a></h2>
    <p>The Admin Dialog requires the following access:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Editor access</strong>: To change the stream title/game</li>
        <li><strong>Edit broadcast</strong>: To change stream tags</li>
        <li><strong>Run commercials</strong>: To run commercials</li>
        <li><strong>View/Change blocked terms</strong>: To view and edit blocked terms</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If some access is missing, please go to <code>Main - Account</code> in
        the main menu and check for the access you need.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="status">Change stream title/game/tags</a></h2>
    <p>The Status-Tab lets you view and (if you have access) change some stream
        settings.</p>
    
    <h3>Set the title</h3>
    <p>Simply enter the stream title you want to use in the input field.</p>
    
    <h3>Select a game/category</h3>
    <p>Use <code>Select game</code> to open a dialog where you can search for
        a game (and other categories like Creative) and also add games to
        favorites.</p>
    
    <h3>Select tags</h3>
    <p>Tags are an additional categorization for streams. You can select up to
        five tags and also add tags to favorites.</p>
    
    <h3>Presets</h3>
    <p>Status Presets allow you to store the current title, game and tags
        for later use. A status is automatically added every time you press the
        <code>Update</code> button (can be disabled in the History settings),
        but will be removed after some time of not being used. You can also add
        the current status to the favorites by pressing the <code>Fav</code>
        button, which means it is never automatically removed from the Status
        Presets.</p>
    
    <p>In the Presets dialog there are different ways to use an entry:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Double-click an entry to use full status</li>
        <li>Select an entry and choose one of the buttons to use full status or just title</li>
        <li>Right-click an entry to open the context menu with various options</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <code>Last Activity</code> column shows when this status was last
        set using the <code>Update</code> button (or when it was added to the
        favorites for the first time). The <code>Usage</code> column shows how
        often it was set using the <code>Update</code> button.</p>

    <h2><a name="commercials">Run commercials</a></h2>
    <p>If you are partnered with Twitch, you can run commercials on your channel
    here (even if you are not partnered it may run a commercial). Click on the
    appropriate button to try to run a commercial of the given length.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Last run</code> time shows when a commercial was last run
    through Chatty (this session).</p>
    
    <h3>Schedule commercials</h3>
    <p>There are two different ways of scheduling a commercial, either running
    a single commerical on a delay or repeating running a commercial on a delay.
    Select either or both options and then press a <code>Run commercial</code>
    button to schedule the commercial. Press the same button again to cancel the
    scheduled commercial. Click a button of another length to change the length
    of the commercial while keeping it on schedule. Scheduled commercials are
    not completely exact, they may be run a few sceonds too late.</p>
    
    <p>If you have <code>Use delay</code> selected, then the commercial will be
        scheduled to run after the specified time. If you have <code>Repeat</code> selected,
    then - after each commercial run through Chatty - another commercial will automatically be scheduled to run again with the same delay.
    You don't need to have <code>Use delay</code> selected for <code>Repeat</code>
    to work, they just both use the same time as delay.</p>
    
    <p>The time for the delay will be interpreted as seconds by default, but you
    can also specify minutes. Examples: <code>30</code> (30 seconds), <code>5m</code>
    (5 minutes), <code>120s</code> (2 minutes).</p>
    
    <h3>Run commercials via global hotkey</h3>
    <p>If you have downloaded the appropriate version of Chatty (the one with
    "hotkey" in the .zip filename, Windows only), you can define a global hotkey
    to run 30s commercials on the channel you currently have open. The hotkey
    can be defined on the <code>Commercials</code> tab in the Admin Dialog
    (don't forget to press <code>Set</code> to actually set it).</p>
    
    <p>If you have the Admin Dialog open on the <code>Commercials</code> tab,
    then executing the hotkey will simulate a click on the 30s button, with all
    the implications like being able to use a delay, running the commercial on
    the channel that the Admin Dialog was opened on (instead of the currently
    active channel) and so on.</p>
