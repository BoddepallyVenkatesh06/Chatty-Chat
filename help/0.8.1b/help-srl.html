    <h1><a name="top">SpeedRunsLive (SRL)</a></h1>

    <p><a href="http://speedrunslive.com">SpeedRunsLive</a> is a platform
    dedicated to speedrunning and racing (live speedruns against other players).
    Chatty has an integrated race viewer, which lists all the current races.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="0.6.3">Race List / Race Info</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Open the race list via <code>SRL - Race List</code>, which shows the
    current races. Right-click on a race to open a contextmenu with several
    options, double-click on a race to open the Race Info dialog.</p>
    
    <p>Notice that the race list isn't automatically updated, unless you have
    a Race Info dialog open (which is automatically updated in a regular
    interval). If you want actual real-time information on races, joining
    the SRL IRC is a good option. The integration in Chatty is mainly supposed
    to make opening/joining race related stuff easier and to give a quick and
    easy overview of who is in a race you are watching (without having to open
    a website).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="0.6.3">Find races with someone</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Use <code>SRL - Races with..</code> to find races that the stream of
    the currently active channel you have joined is part of. This will basicially
    take the stream you have clicked on, search through all the current races
    and list all the races that have an entrant that has that stream set. If
    there is only one matching race, and you currently don't have the Race Info
    dialog open, then it is immediately opened. Otherwise the matching races are
    listed for you to select.</p>
