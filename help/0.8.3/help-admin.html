    <h1><a name="top">Admin Dialog</a></h1>
    <p>
        <a href="#status">Change game/title</a> | 
        <a href="#commercials">Run commercials</a>
    </p>

    <p><em>Open the Admin Dialog via <code>View - Channel Admin</code> or by
            right-clicking on the channel to open the context menu and choose
            <code>Channel Admin</code>.</em></p>
    
    <p>In the Admin Dialog you can change the title/game of your channel and
    run commercials, if you have allowed the necessary access when getting your
    login data. You need <code>Editor access</code> for changing game/title and
    <code>Commercial access</code> for running commercials. See <a href="help.html#access">allow more access</a>.</p>
    <p>The Admin Dialog is always opened for the currently selected channel,
    unless there is no channel open (which is the case just after you started Chatty),
    in which case it will always be opened for your own channel, which is derived
    from your configured account name.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="status">Change game/title</a></h2>
    <p>The Status-Tab lets you view and change the title and game of your channel.
    The information is loaded when you open the dialog and when you press the
    <code>reload</code>-Button. If others may have changed the info in the meantime,
    you may want to reload before trying to change it.</p>
    
    <h3>Select a game</h3>
    <p>When you select a game, another dialog will open where you should enter
        part of the name of the game in the search field and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
        or click the <code>Search</code>-Button to find the correct name, which
    you can then select. You can also just use the name you entered yourself,
    but you should usually use the search to make sure your stream appears in
    the correct category on Twitch.</p>
    
    <h3>Use presets</h3>
    <p>There are also status presets, which allow you to add a combination of
        title and game, so you can select it later. By pressing <code>Fav</code>
        on the Status-Tab, you can add the current status to the favorites.
        The status is also automatically added to the history every time you
        press the <code>Update</code> button.</p>
    <p>Press the <code>Presets</code> button to open a table with the favorites
        and status history. You can filter the table by only showing entries for
        the game currently have selected or only showing favorites.</p>
    <p>History entries (the ones that are not favorites) are automatically
        removed after some time, you can change when they are removed and
        whether they should be added in the first place in the settings.</p>
    <p>The <code>Last Activity</code> columns shows when this status was last
        set using the <code>Update</code> button (or when it was added to the
        favorites for the first time). The <code>Usage</code> column shows how
        often it was set using the <code>Update</code> button.</p>

    <h2><a name="commercials">Run commercials</a></h2>
    <p>If you are partnered with Twitch, you can run commercials on your channel
    here (even if you are not partnered it may run a commercial). Click on the
    appropriate button to try to run a commercial of the given length.</p>
    
    <p>The <code>Last run</code> time shows when a commercial was last run
    through Chatty (this session).</p>
    
    <h3>Schedule commercials</h3>
    <p>There are two different ways of scheduling a commercial, either running
    a single commerical on a delay or repeating running a commercial on a delay.
    Select either or both options and then press a <code>Run commercial</code>
    button to schedule the commercial. Press the same button again to cancel the
    scheduled commercial. Click a button of another length to change the length
    of the commercial while keeping it on schedule. Scheduled commercials are
    not completely exact, they may be run a few sceonds too late.</p>
    
    <p>If you have <code>Use delay</code> selected, then the commercial will be
        scheduled to run after the specified time. If you have <code>Repeat</code> selected,
    then - after each commercial run through Chatty - another commercial will automatically be scheduled to run again with the same delay.
    You don't need to have <code>Use delay</code> selected for <code>Repeat</code>
    to work, they just both use the same time as delay.</p>
    
    <p>The time for the delay will be interpreted as seconds by default, but you
    can also specify minutes. Examples: <code>30</code> (30 seconds), <code>5m</code>
    (5 minutes), <code>120s</code> (2 minutes).</p>
    
    <h3>Run commercials via global hotkey</h3>
    <p>If you have downloaded the appropriate version of Chatty (the one with
    "hotkey" in the .zip filename, Windows only), you can define a global hotkey
    to run 30s commercials on the channel you currently have open. The hotkey
    can be defined on the <code>Commercials</code> tab in the Admin Dialog
    (don't forget to press <code>Set</code> to actually set it).</p>
    
    <p>If you have the Admin Dialog open on the <code>Commercials</code> tab,
    then executing the hotkey will simulate a click on the 30s button, with all
    the implications like being able to use a delay, running the commercial on
    the channel that the Admin Dialog was opened on (instead of the currently
    active channel) and so on.</p>
