    <p><a href="http://livestreamer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Livestreamer</a>
    is a commandline program that can be used to watch streams in a player like
    VLC Player. It has to be downloaded and installed seperately from Chatty.</p>

    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    <p>You can open the Livestreamer dialog that Chatty provides via 
    <code>Extra - Livestreamer</code>, where you can directly run Livestreamer
    and change some settings.</p>
    
    <p>Each time you open a stream via the dialog or a context menu, a tab is
    added to the dialog where the output of the Livestreamer process is
    redirected to. If you open a stream with the same stream name and quality you already
    have open in a tab whose process isn't currently running, then that tab will
    be reused.</p>

    <p>The tab of a stream is automatically closed when you close the Video
    Player opened by Livestreamer, if the dialog isn't currently open. Otherwise
    you have to close it yourself by using the <code>Close</code>-button on the
    top right, which turns into an <code>End process</code>-button as long as
    the process is still running. The <code>Retry</code>-button can be used to
    re-run the last command of that tab (for example when it couldn't find the
    stream, but you want to retry now because you know it's come online).</p>
    
    <h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
    <p>The settings can be changed in the Livestreamer dialog.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable context menu entry</strong>: Adds Livestreamer to all
        context menus that can be used to open streams (like User Context Menu,
        Channel Context Menu or Live Streams Context Menu).</li>
        <li><strong>Show dialog when opening stream</strong>: Automatically open
        the Livestreamer Dialog when you open a stream out of the context menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Context menu qualities</strong>: You can customize which
        quality options appear in the context menu. The options you enter here
        are directly given as a parameter to Livestreamer, except <code>Select</code>
        which tells Chatty you want to select a quality in the dialog. Seperate
        qualities by space or comma. Add a <code>|</code> (vertical bar) to add
        a seperator to the menu.
        
        <br /><br />
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li><code>Best, High, Worst | Select</code></li>
            <li><code>Source High Medium Low Mobile | Select</code></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Base command or commandline options</strong>: This is used to
        construct the command to run Livestreamer and is basicially the part
        before the URL and the quality. This should point to the Livestreamer
        program itself, including any commandline options you always want to have included. The default is just <code>livestreamer</code>, which
        should usually be sufficient if the program is correctly included in
        the systems PATH variable (or similiar), but it may also include the
        full path to Livestreamer. Surround the path or any other parameter with quotes if it contains
        spaces (e.g. <code>"C:\My Programs\Livestreamer\livestreamer.exe"</code>).
        <br /><br />
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li><code>"C:\My Programs\Livestreamer\livestreamer.exe" --player "C:\Program
                    Files\MPC-HC\mpc-hc64.exe"</code> (specify full path to Livestreamer
            and use a different player)</li>
            <li><code>/usr/local/bin/livestreamer</code> (this might work on Linux/Mac
            if it can't find Livestreamer without the full path)</li>
        </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use Authorization (Twitch Oauth Token)</strong>: Supplies to
        Twitch Access Token that is used for Chatty to Livestreamer to authenticate
        you when watching a stream via Livestreamer (probably only necessary to
        be able to watch sub-only streams).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
    <p>If you get an error like <code>Error: java.io.IOException: Cannot run
            program "&lt;...&gt;": CreateProcess error=2 [..]</code>, then
    Chatty probably can't find Livestreamer on your system.</p>
    
    <p>To solve this, first make sure that
    you actually have Livestreamer installed. You need to install it on you own, it does
    not come bundled with Chatty. If you are sure it is installed (and you maybe can
    run it from the commandline just fine), you may have to tell Chatty the full
    path to the Livestreamer executable for it to work by entering it in the
    <code>Base command or commandline options</code> field. See the Settings section
    above for examples and help on that.</p>
